Quantum computing 101 for non-physicists
========================================

The goal of this document is to provide a gentle introduction to quantum computing for someone with technical background but not physics background.
It is assumed that the reader is familiar with

* linear algebra
* probability theory

The principles I follow in preparing this material are

* Concise is better than verbose.
* Concrete is better than abstract.
* Self-contained is better than cross-referencing.

Choices of the materials are biased to my interest.
