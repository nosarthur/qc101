Quantum computing 101 for non-physicists
========================================

This is a gentle introduction to quantum computing for someone with technical background but not physics background.
Specifically, I hope to get the readers familiar with the jargons in this field.
Thus links to Wikipedia are provided.

The reader is assumed to be familiar with

* linear algebra
* probability theory

The principles I follow in preparing this material are

* Concise is better than verbose.
* Concrete is better than abstract.
* Goal-oriented is better than aimless
* Self-contained is better than cross-referencing.

In my experience, making analogy is very helpful in learning new things.
Thus I will use it whenever possible.

Choices of the materials are biased to my interest.
