Quantum computing 101 for non-physicists
========================================

This is a gentle introduction to quantum computing for someone with technical background but not physics background.
Specifically, I hope to get the readers familiar with the jargons in this field.

The reader is assumed to be familiar with

* linear algebra
* probability theory

Specifically, the following equations should look familar

* :math:`\mathbf F = m\mathbf a`
* :math:`\frac{d}{dt}\mathbf p = W\mathbf p`

bonus

* :math:`i\frac{d}{dt}\psi = H\psi`

The principles I follow in preparing this material are

* Concise is better than verbose.
* Concrete is better than abstract.
* Task-oriented is better than rambling.
* Comprehensive is better than referencing.

In my experience, making analogy is very helpful in learning new things.
Thus I will use it whenever possible.

Choices of the materials are biased to my interest.
