What's next
***********

In this book we only have a superficial acquitance of limited topics.
Apart from hiding all hardware implementations,
we also fully ignored many important topics.
The most important two topics of practical concern are

* :wiki:`quantum decoherence`: This is about how things could go wrong and it is
  the reason why we don't have an awesome quantum computer yet.
* :wiki:`quantum error correction`: This is the counterpart of classical error correction and it is meant to fight decoherence.
